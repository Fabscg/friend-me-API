  # Description
   I had build APIs for a social network app. When I enter the command to invoke the application THEN the server start and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. I am able to type the API to see all usernames, a single user by ID, to see their friends, to delete, to see the user's thoughts and also see reactions from the friends. 

  # Installation
      express mongoose

  # Usage
  When you open the project in the terminal, from the file's root directory you need to invoke "npm start", then you need to open insomnia to test every single API necessary to find the username, thoughts, reactions and friends.
